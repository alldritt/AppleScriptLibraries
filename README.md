# AppleScript Libraries

Here is a collection of AppleScript libraries which I use regularly which others may find useful.  This code also forms the basis for a series of blog posts on [markalldritt.com](http://markalldritt.com).

## Libraries

 - [MarksLib](MarksLib.md)

 - [MarkdownLib](MarkdownLib.md)

 - [DiscourseLib](DiscourseLib.md)


## The Future

I hope to add additional libraries to this repository as time goes on.  If you want to improve on my work, Pull Requests are always welcome.  Please direct questions to the [Late Night Software Support Forum](http://form.latenightsw.com).
